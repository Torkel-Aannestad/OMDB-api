# OMDB API

This project is a personal learning project. OMDB API is a movie and series database presented as a JSON-api. The data is downloaded from [OMDB](https://www.omdb.org) which is a free community driven database for film media. The goal of the project has been to create a full featured ideomatic Go JSON API, which uses few dependencies and abstractions.

Stack:

- HTTPRouter for routing
- PostgreSQL database
- Models built with raw SQL and Go standard libary
- Auth and user management built from cratch
- Mailer implemented with Go-mail and Mailtrap SMTP relay
- Makefile for automations
- Hosting from a Ubuntu VM with Nginx reverse proxy and rsync for file transfer and shell scripts

Sentral to the design of the application is Alex Edwards' books [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) and [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/). You can read more about the technology stack and design desitions taken in the project below.

## Quickstart

The API is open for anyone to use. Sign up and activate you user account and you are ready to use the API. The database will occationally be reset, but please don't perform to many destructive operations.

You'll get access with 3 steps:

1. User signup
2. Confirm your email with token
3. Authenticate with email and password to get a request token

### 1. User Signup

- Base url: https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com
- Endpoint: POST /v1/users
- Body: name, email, password

```shell
  BODY='{"name": "Jake Perolta","email": "jake.perolta@example.com", "password": "yourSecurePassword"}'
  curl -d "$BODY" https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com/v1/users
```

### 2. User Activation

An email is sent to your email with activation token. Send the following request to active your account.

- Endpoint: PUT /v1/users/activate
- Body: token

```shell
  BODY='{"token": token-from-email}'
  curl -X PUT -d "$BODY" https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com/v1/users/activate
```

Reponse: a user object with updated "activated" value.

### 3. Get Auth Token

- Endpoint: POST /v1/auth/authentication
- Body: email, password

```shell
  BODY='{"email": "yourEmail@example.com", "password": "pa55word"}'
  curl -d "$BODY" https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com/v1/auth/authentication
```

Response:

```JSON
{"authentication_token":{"token":"yourTokenHere","expiry":"2024-12-13T09:16:07.9290901Z"}}
```

<br/>
<strong>Request data</strong>

- Endpoint: GET /v1/movies/:id

```shell
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer yourTokenHere" https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com/v1/movies/35819
```

## Database and Model design

- OMDB is imported from CSV files. An import SQL script is created to set up the data model in a good starting state. See /sql/data-import/run.sql for all the set up steps.
- Added to Makefile to transfer csv data and import to DB in production.
- After initial data import migrations are handled with goose from the sql/schema directory.
- sqlc is configured for autogenerating json tags for Go structs. The generated types are not used directly but copied and modified. This way we get better control over the context.Context instance and error handling. We also get full control when needing to build dynamic queries.
- PostgreSQL configured with citext plugin for user email column to make string case insensitive.
- Full text search features in PostgreSQL is configured to enabled a good search experience with for examample movies or people resources.

## Mailer

- MailTrap for sending transational emails.
- go-mail for handling SMTP.
- Sending email with background Go routine
- Email templates are found in assets/templates

## Middleware

- Authenticate middleware ensures that we retrieve the user from the database or know that the user is anonymous. The user is added to the request context your later use.
- The protectedRoute middleware bounces the user if she is not activated, has the right permission or is anonymous.

## MISC

- IP based rate limiting with x/time/rate package
- Getting user's IP with Realip package
  - github.com/tomasen/realip
- Error triage is implemented in readJSON() helper function to ensure that potensial errors from reading json body is caught and error messages regarding what the issue is can be sendt to the user. A standardized set of response messages are found in cmd/api/errors.go to ensure that only known formulations will reach the end user, and thus hiding for example error messages bubbling from PostgreSQL.

## Roadmap

- Improved testing
- More advance auth features like MFA and additional rate limiting on auth endpoints.

## API Documentaion

Base URL and example endpoint:

```shell
 https://omdb-api.torkelaannestad.com/v1/healthcheck
```

- To get access to the API please see the [quickstart section](#Quickstart) or the [users](#Users) and [auth](#Authentication) resources.
- Error handling and expected status codes are found in [error handling](#Error-Handling).
- Permissions. The api is implementet with permission based authorization. Upon signup your user will be granted both read and write access to most resources. Please behave nicely.
- Optimistic concurrency control is applied to any records that can be updated thought the version field. This way multile simultanious requests to update a will fail with status code 409 conflict.
